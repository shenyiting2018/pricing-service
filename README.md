Pricing Alert Service
================================
Welcome! This is a pricing alert service written by Yiting Shen. (I'm currently a CS Master student at Santa Clara University, actively looking for 2020 summer internship)

As a girl I always have a strong shopping intention and sometimes I do feel frustrative when I missed some items on sale. As a Computer Science student, I decided to use my knowledge and skills to build a website to set up pricing alerts for all my favorite items.
